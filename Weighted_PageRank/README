The weighted PageRank compute the importance of each page as follows:

I(Q) = (1-f) * H(Q) + f * Î£_{P->Q} I(P) * W(P,Q)  

where H(Q) is the inherent quality of Q, here we use log_2(#words in Q),
W(P,Q) is the weight of link (P,Q). Score 1 for a link from P to Q.
If the link is in a special scope like < H1 >, < em > or < b > tag, add 1. 
If there is more than one link from P to Q, add up all the scores for the links to get the total score. 

Also, we normalize 
H(Q) = H(Q)/total length of all pages,
W(P,Q) = W(P,Q)/total weight of all out-links of P
if there is no out-links of P
set W(P,Q) = 1/#total pages for all Q

Therefore, the weight matrix would be a dence one.
