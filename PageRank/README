1. Intro

This is to compute PageRank using Power Iteration
The formula to compute PageRank of node i is like
P_0(i) = 1P_k(i) = 1-d + d\sum_{(j,i)\in E} \frac{P_{k-1}(j)}{O_j}
where 
E is the set of edges, O_j is the number of out-links of node j
and d is the damping factor.

Until
||P_k-P_{k-1}|| < \epsilon (Euclidean distance)

2. Execution
python3 PR.py [-d damping-factor] [-e epsilong] [-i maxIter] [-o output-file] input-file

3. Evaluation
Note that the PageRank computed by this method is not normalized, which means the value could be greater than 1.
Given a standard result, we can evaluate our result by comparing the two file using
1.L1 norm
2.Spearmanâ€™s rho
